# Serverless-Function-Vulnerability-Scanner

The Serverless Function Vulnerability Scanner is a Python script designed to scan serverless functions for vulnerabilities. It identifies potential security issues such as insecure dependencies, sensitive data exposure, excessive permissions, and common misconfigurations in AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.

## Features

- Sensitive Data Detection: Scans function code and dependencies for sensitive data exposure, such as API keys and credentials.
- Dynamic Analysis: Performs dynamic analysis by invoking functions with sample input data and monitoring behavior for security issues.
- Third-Party Library Analysis: Checks for outdated or insecure third-party libraries using vulnerability databases.
- Common Security Misconfigurations: Identifies common security misconfigurations like overly permissive IAM roles and unencrypted environment variables.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate vulnerability scanning during deployment.
- User-Friendly Reporting: Generates detailed reports with remediation recommendations and severity levels.
- Cloud-Specific Scanning: Supports AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.
- Custom Rules Engine: Allows users to define custom security rules and checks.
- Logging and Auditing: Keeps a record of all scans and results for compliance and tracking.
- Notification System: Alerts administrators or developers when critical vulnerabilities are discovered.
- Security Baseline Checks: Ensures compliance with predefined security baselines or standards.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the scanner with the desired options:

bash

    python serverless_scanner.py -t <target-function-url> -o <output-directory>

    Replace <target-function-url> with the URL of the serverless function to scan and <output-directory> with the directory where reports will be saved.

    Review the generated reports for vulnerabilities and compliance status.

Configuration

You can configure various options and custom rules in the config.py file.
